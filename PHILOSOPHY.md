# SoftwareLogBook
**A service logbook for software systems**

## Why SoftwareLogBook exists
Modern software systems live for years — often longer than their original authors, teams, or documentation.
While source code repositories preserve what changed, they rarely explain why, under what conditions,
or with which operational consequences.

SoftwareLogBook exists to close this gap.

It provides a human-readable, append-only record of a software system’s lifecycle:
- development milestones
- operational changes
- maintenance activities
- incidents and their resolutions
- security-relevant events

Not as tickets. Not as metrics. But as documented responsibility over time.

## What SoftwareLogBook is
A technology-agnostic, tool-agnostic, process-neutral service logbook.
Chronology is the primary dimension.

## What SoftwareLogBook is not
Not a ticket system, not project management, not CI/CD, not monitoring, not automated event collection.

## Core principles
1. Responsibility over automation
2. Chronology over structure
3. Append-only mindset
4. Transparency over completeness
5. Portability and longevity

## Open by design
MIT licensed. The value is clarity and discipline — not lock-in.

## Final note
SoftwareLogBook does not try to be smart. It tries to be reliable.
If a software system matters, its history should be readable.
